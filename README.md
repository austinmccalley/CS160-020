# Austin McCalley CS 160-020

This is the GitHub repository of my Fall 2019 CS 160 class at Oreogn State. All my labs and coding exercises will be completed here for myself to be able to access in the future. Hopefully in the future I will refactor this with code that is actually readable and learn from my mistakes.

## Requirements
All labs in this GitHub repo are written using Python3

## Class Information
This class was taught by Dr. Jennifer Parham-Mocello.
